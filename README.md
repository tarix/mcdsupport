MCD Support
-----------

*Support for this addon was discontinued on March 15, 2015 but I continue to update it for my pesonal use.*

This Anki 2.1 addon provides additional support for creating MCDs (Massive-context Cloze Deletion) cards as well as MCBs (Massive-context Cloze Bolded) cards.

The original inspiration for this plugin was based on blog posts written at AJATT but has since moved away from that by incorporating ideas from several Japanese learning blogs and forums.
