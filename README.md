MCD Support
-----------

*As of March 15, 2015 I will no longer be providing support for this plugin. However, a version of it will be updated to support Anki 2.1*

This plugin for Anki 2.0 provides additional support for creating MCDs (Massive-context Cloze Deletion) cards as well as MCBs (Massive-context Cloze Bolded) cards.

The original inspiration for this plugin was based on blog posts written at AJATT but has since moved away from that by incorporating ideas from several Japanese leaner blogs.
